# Preface

[**Shambhala**][shambhala] is a convenient and secure
_transaction-signing service_ based on:

- [Multisignature][multisig]
- [Symmetric encryption][symenc]
- [Web Storage]
- In-browser [cross-origin communication][coc]


_**User**_ is the only owner of the `MASTER MNEMONIC` with an optional
`PASSPHRASE` (see [BIP-0039][bip39]) and thus effectively is
**the only owner** of the `MASTER PRIVATE KEY` to the account.
The _**user**_ is, therefore, **the one and only entity in full control
of such account**.


Opting-out of _shambhala service_ is strictly up to the _**user**_ and
cannot be prevented.


[Transaction XDR][transaction] and [signatures][signature] exchange is done
using in-browser [cross-origin communication][coc] preventing most of
the threats listed in [Security Best Practices][sep07sec] chapter
of [SEP-0007][sep07].


Variants of onboarding / modes of operation:

* **[Variant A]** - provides full and secure key management solution.
    Generates `"MASTER" MNEMONIC` for a _**user**_ and allows
    him/her to choose a `PASSPHRASE`. Typical cases include:

    - no previous experience with the _[stellar]_ ecosystem
    - no account entry on the _[stellar]_ ledger
    - no ownership of private key(s) for the _[stellar]_ account(s)
    - rudimentary/no knowledge about general [crypto][cryptography]

* **[Variant B]** - assumes that _**user**_ possesses means of generating
    a valid signature that can be attached to a transaction, which should be
    then successfuly validated by the _[stellar] network_. Account has to have
    a minimum reserve for data subentries as well as operation costs.
    Valid signature allows for full, secure key management for the account
    the user is claiming. Typical cases include:

    - user has previously generated a valid public/private keypair
        for _[stellar] network_ and has created account with enough funds
    - user owns a secure element keyring (also known as the
        _["hardware wallet"][hardware_wallet]_ i.e. _[LedgerHQ]_) and can sign
        a transaction on the _[stellar] network_
    - user possesses some knowledge about cryptography, _[stellar]_ ecosystem
        and can manage signing of transactions externally by any means

<br />
<br />

# Actors

* _**[user][user_computing]**_ - [汨ｨ汨ｩ] - A human interacting with the system.


* _**[host application][host_app_dir]**_ - [汳ｻ] - Any application
    that operates on / interacts with the _[stellar] network_ and needs
    a robust [transaction] signing mechanism, e.g. _wallet_ or _exchange_.


* _**[client][client_app_dir]**_ - [沁ｭ] - _Shambhala frontend service_
    interacting with the _**[user][user_computing]**_,
    _**[host application][host_app_dir]**_ and _**[server][server_app_dir]**_.
    Responsible for storing data in [Web Storage], key derivation,
    encryption/dectyption of secrets and, most importantly,
    inspecting and signing transactions.


* _**[server][server_app_dir]**_ - [沛｢] - _Shambhala backend service_
    interacting with the _**[client][client_app_dir]**_. Responsible for
    storing data in database, key validation, encryption/decryption of secrets,
    checking permissions, checking constraints and signing transactions.

# Architecture overview

![Architecture overview](./diagrams/shambhala.arch.overview.svg)

<br />
<br />
<br />




# Fundamental operations

Current set of fundamental operations is build on top of:

* [cryptops][cryptopslib] library:
    - [Stanford Javascript Crypto Library][sjcl]
    - _node.js_ [crypto][node_crypto] module and [crypto-browserify][cr_br] implementation
    - [Tweet NaCl JavaScript][tweetnacl_js] library
    - [scrypt js][scrypt_js] library
* [stellar JavaScript SDK][js_stellar_sdk]
* [redshift][redshiftlib] library

<br />




## Crypto-related operations

> For current implementation please refer to [cryptops.js][cryptops].

* generation of a random value which can be used
    as a [salt], [nonce] or [pepper]:

    ```javascript
    // random 256-bit value
    const salt32 = () => { ... }

    // random 512-bit value
    const salt64 = () => { ... }
    ```


* [password-based key-derivation][key_derivation]:

    ```javascript
    // pbkdf2, not too many iterations, 256-bit output
    const genKey = (pass, salt32) => { ... }

    // scrypt, 2^16 iterations, 512-bit output
    const deriveKey = (pass, salt64) => { ... }
    ```


* [symmetric][sym_key] [encryption]:

    ```javascript
    // two round xsalsa20-poly1305/aes encryption,
    // key composed of two 256-bit keys
    const encrypt = (key, secret) => { ... }
    ```


* [symmetric][sym_key] decryption:

    ```javascript
    // two round aes/xsalsa20-poly1305 decryption,
    // key composed of two 256-bit keys
    const decrypt = (key, ciphertext) => { ... }
    ```


* generation of 128-bit [Universally Unique Identifier]:

    ```javascript
    // monotonic, 128-bit value:
    //     - 48 bits of miliseconds since epoch
    //     - 32 bits of truncated `sha256` sum of userAgent string
    //     - 48 random bits
    const genUUID = () => { ... }
    ```

<br />




## Transaction-related operations

> For current implementation please refer to [txops.js][txops].

* [transaction] inspection:

    ```javascript
    // decode relevant information from a given
    // `TransactionSignaturePayload` XDR
    const inspectTSP = (tspXDR) => { ... }
    ```


* [transaction] signing:

    ```javascript
    // sign given `TransactionSignaturePayload` XDR using provided
    // _stellar_ secret key and produce valid signature
    const signTSP = (secret, tspXDR) => { ... }
    ```

## 3. Transaction signing

> For current implementation please refer to
> [client/sign_transaction.js][client_signtransaction]
> and [server/sign_transaction.js][server_signtransaction].

* _**client**_ - [沁ｭ]:

    - ask _**user**_ to provide a `PIN`

    - compute `S_KEY`:

        ```javascript
        let S_KEY = cryptops.deriveKey(PIN, SALT)
        ```

    - send `S_KEY` and `TX_PAYLOAD` to the _**server**_

    - [汳･] - destroy `PIN` and `S_KEY`


* _**server**_ - [沛｢]:

    - receive `S_KEY` and `TX_PAYLOAD` from the _**client**_

    - extract `S_SECRET` and `PEPPER` by decrypting `ENC_SKP`:

        ```javascript
        let [PEPPER, S_SECRET] = cryptops.decrypt(S_KEY, ENC_SKP)
        ```

    - if the extraction has failed it means that received `S_KEY` is invalid,
        so potential data breach occured on the _**client**_ side or simply
        _**user**_ made a typo in `KEY`. In such scenario next steps
        are impossible, so the procedure has to be aborted,
        _failure counter_ has to be increased and the _**client**_ has
        to be notified. Security precautions can be implemented in this step,
        for example after `3` failed attempts communication with this
        _**client**_ should be suspended for a longer period of time, etc.

    - generate `SKP`:

        ```javascript
        let SKP = StellarSDK.Keypair.fromSecret(S_SECRET)
        ```

    - compute `S_SIGNATURE` by singing `TX_PAYLOAD` with `SKP`:

        ```javascript
        let S_SIGNATURE = txops.signTSB(SKP, TX_PAYLOAD)
        ```

    - [汳･] - destroy `SKP` and `S_SECRET`

    - compute `C_PASSPHRASE`:

        ```javascript
        let C_PASSPHRASE = cryptops.genKey(S_KEY, PEPPER)
        ```

    - send `C_PASSPHRASE` and `S_SIGNATURE` to the _**client**_

    - [汳･] - destroy `S_KEY`, `PEPPER`, `C_PASSPHRASE`


* _**client**_ - [沁ｭ]:

    - receive `C_PASSPHRASE` and `S_SIGNATURE` from the _**server**_

    - compute `C_KEY`:

        ```javascript
        let C_KEY = cryptops.deriveKey(C_PASSPHRASE, SALT)
        ```

    - extract `C_SECRET` by decrypting `ENC_CKP`:

        ```javascript
        let C_SECRET = cryptops.decrypt(C_KEY, ENC_CKP)
        ```

    - generate `CKP`:

        ```javascript
        let CKP = StellarSDK.Keypair.fromSecret(C_SECRET)
        ```

    - compute `C_SIGNATURE` by singing `TX_PAYLOAD` with `CKP`:

        ```javascript
         let C_SIGNATURE = txops.signTSB(CKP, TX_PAYLOAD)
         ```

    - [汳･] - destroy `CKP`, `C_SECRET`, `C_PASSPHRASE` and `C_KEY`

    - send `S_SIGNATURE` and `C_SIGNATURE` to the _**host application**_


* _**host application**_ - [汳ｻ]:

    - attach received signatured to constructed transaction

    - send the signed transaction to the _[stellar] network_

<br />
<br />
<br />




# Offboarding process _(idea)_

* _**User**_ uses his/her `G_MNEMONIC` with `PASSPHRASE` to generate `GKP`
  and dissociate (with an appropriate _[setOptions]_ operation) `C_PUBLIC`
  and `S_PUBLIC` keys from his/her account.


* _**User**_ demands from _shambhala_ (by calling appropriate API function)
  to delete `ENC_CKP` and `ENC_SKP` structures.


* _Shambhala_ checks `signers` array on a `G_PUBLIC` account and if there are
  no `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC` signers, then `ENC_CKP` and `ENC_SKP` can
  be safely deleted.

# Notes

* There's no way to enforce garbage collect process / shredding of
    memory remains in JavaScript. All places marked with [汳･] are currently
    hard (unknown) to achieve in a JavaScript environment.


* After onboarding it is desirable to turn off the phone / computer
    for at least 30 (??) seconds to wipe out DRAM.


* Steps marked with [笶余 in the onboarding process are fragile from
    the security point of view. They are related to very sensitive
    areas - generation of `G_MNEMONIC`, access to and usage of `GKP` and
    `"MASTER" PRIVATE KEY`.


* There is always a tradeoff between security and convenience. Also,
    the more convenient a solution is (in the sense, that an _**user**_ is not
    neccesarily an expert in a given field), the more chance there is
    that some degree of trust to a third party has to be calculated in.


* Safety of a described scheme is build on a following foundations:

    - all communication between _**host application**_ and _**client**_
        is done within browser and using [cross-origin communication][coc] methods
    - all communication betwen _**client**_ and _**server**_ is done
        over [HTTPS]
    - there are two equally important keypairs (`CKP` and `SKP`), both
        stored in an encrypted form (`ENC_CKP` and `ENC_SKP` respectively)
    - _secret keys_ of both `CKP` and `SKP` are never leaving their
        environments (that is [Web Storage] in case of `CKP` and server-side
        database in case of `SKP`)
    - _**user**_ **knows** `PIN` and **has** `SALT`, which are the two
        neccessary ingredients to derive `S_KEY` needed to decrypt `SKP`,
        so in case of server-side database breach `SKP` is safe
    - decryption of `CKP` depends on _**user**_ **knowledge** (`PIN`) and,
        amongs other things, on element stored in **encrypted form** on server
        (`PEPPER`), so in case of client-side storage breach `CKP` is safe
    - if _**user**_ will loose a device with stored `CKP` or forget a `PIN` or
        simply want to cancel using _shambhala transaction-signing scheme_,
        his/her funds on the _[stellar] network_ are safe, because he/she
        **knows** `G_MNEMONIC` with `PASSPHRASE` from which the **master key**
        can be derived
    - the same apply to the situation in which eventual server-side data loss
        occurs - **master key** is in the posession of a _**user**_, so funds
        on the _[stellar] account_ are safe and accessible


* Strong emphasis has to be put on all security considerations related to
    onboarding process in **[Variant A]**.
