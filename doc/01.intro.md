# Preface

[**Shambhala**][shambhala] is a convenient and secure
_transaction-signing service_ based on:

- [Multisignature][multisig]
- [Symmetric encryption][symenc]
- [Web Storage]
- In-browser [cross-origin communication]


_**User**_ is the only owner of the `MASTER MNEMONIC` with an optional
`PASSPHRASE` (see [BIP-39]) and thus effectively is
**the only owner** of the `MASTER PRIVATE KEY` to the account.
The _**user**_ is, therefore, **the one and only entity in full control
of such account**.


Opting-out of _shambhala service_ is strictly up to the _**user**_ and
cannot be prevented.


[Transaction XDR][transaction] and [signatures][signature] exchange is done
using in-browser [cross-origin communication] preventing most of
the threats listed in [Security Best Practices][SEP07sec] chapter
of [SEP-0007].


Variants of onboarding / modes of operation:

* **[Variant A]** - generates `"MASTER" MNEMONIC` for a _**user**_
    and allows him/her to choose a `PASSPHRASE`:

    - for the "first-time"/new users
    - and/or without the prior experience with the _[stellar] network_
    - and/or without much knowledge about [crypto][cryptography] in general

* **[Variant B]** - assumes that _**user**_ already has an account on the
    _[stellar] network_:

    - for users already possesing account on the _[stellar] network_
    - and/or for experienced users with the _[stellar] network_ knowledge
    - and/or possesing _[LedgerHQ] device_

<br />
<br />
<br />




# Basic operations

Current set of basic operations is build on top of:

* [Stanford Javascript Crypto Library][sjcl]
* _node.js_ [crypto][node-crypto] module and [crypto-browserify] implementation
* [Tweet NaCl JavaScript][tweetnacl-js] library
* [scrypt-js] library
* [stellar JavaScript SDK][js-stellar-sdk]
* [redshift] library

For current implementation please refer to [cryptops.js] and [txops.js].

<br />




## Crypto-related operations

* generation of a random value which can be used
    as a [salt], [nonce] or [pepper]:

    ```javascript
    // random 256-bit value
    const salt32 = () => { ... }

    // random 512-bit value
    const salt64 = () => { ... }
    ```


* [password-based key-derivation][key-derivation]:

    ```javascript
    // pbkdf2, not too many iterations, 256-bit output
    const genKey = (pass, salt32) => { ... }

    // scrypt, 2^16 iterations, 512-bit output
    const deriveKey = (pass, salt64) => { ... }
    ```


* [symmetric][sym-key] [encryption]:

    ```javascript
    // two round xsalsa20-poly1305/aes encryption,
    // key composed of two 256-bit keys
    const encrypt = (key, secret) => { ... }
    ```


* [symmetric][sym-key] decryption:

    ```javascript
    // two round aes/xsalsa20-poly1305 decryption,
    // key composed of two 256-bit keys
    const decrypt = (key, ciphertext) => { ... }
    ```


* generation of 128-bit [Universally Unique Identifier]:

    ```javascript
    // monotonic, 128-bit value:
    //     - 48 bits of miliseconds since epoch
    //     - 32 bits of truncated `sha256` sum of userAgent string
    //     - 48 random bits
    const genUUID = () => { ... }
    ```

<br />




## Transaction-related operations

* [transaction] inspection:

    ```javascript
    // decode relevant information from a given
    // `TransactionSignatureBase` XDR
    const inspectTSB = (tsbXDR) => { ... }
    ```


* [transaction] signing:

    ```javascript
    // sign given `TransactionSignatureBase` XDR using provided
    // stellar KeyPair and produce valid signature
    const signTSB = (kp, tsbXDR) => { ... }
    ```

<br />
<br />
<br />

# Transaction signing process _(draft)_

<br />


## 1. Initial state

* _**user**_ - [üë®üë©]:

    - know his/her `PIN`
    - has already associated `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC`
        to his/her account during the process of onboarding


* _**client**_ - [üé≠]:

    ```javascript
    let clientData = {
        G_PUBLIC: "GDVKSJYZ...",
        C_UUID: "01663f03...",
        C_PUBLIC: "GDNQLOS2...",
        S_PUBLIC: "GASVBIEZ...",
        SALT: "1f93a39461e87f2320071ad38362685...",
        ENC_CKP: "2rAAAey7/PNEaPpKNG8BtEZZOXFGaXLPDG..."
    }
    ```


* _**server**_ - [üè¢]:

    ```javascript
    let serverData = {
        G_PUBLIC: "GDVKSJYZ...",
        C_UUID: "01663f03...",
        S_PUBLIC: "GASVBIEZ...",
        ENC_SKP: "AWY/D5eKB9FxqqS/wt8XDgfDy..."
    }
    ```

<br />




## 2. Transaction verification

* _**host application**_ - [üíª]:

    - request transaction signing:

        ```javascript
        shambhala.signTransaction(G_PUBLIC, TX_PAYLOAD)
        ```


* _**client**_ - [üé≠]:

    - decode `TX_PAYLOAD` received from a _**host application**_
        and present it to the _**user**_:

        ```javascript
        return txops.inspectTSB(TX_PAYLOAD)
        ```

        - source account identifier
        - transaction fee
        - sequence number
        - time bounds
        - memo
        - operations

<br />




## 3. Transaction signing

* _**client**_ - [üé≠]:

    - ask _**user**_ to provide a `PIN`

    - compute `S_KEY`:

        ```javascript
        let S_KEY = cryptops.deriveKey(PIN, SALT)
        ```

    - send `S_KEY` and `TX_PAYLOAD` to the _**server**_

    - [üí•] - destroy `PIN` and `S_KEY`


* _**server**_ - [üè¢]:

    - receive `S_KEY` and `TX_PAYLOAD` from the _**client**_

    - extract `S_SECRET` and `PEPPER` by decrypting `ENC_SKP`:

        ```javascript
        let [PEPPER, S_SECRET] = cryptops.decrypt(S_KEY, ENC_SKP)
        ```

    - if the extraction has failed it means that received `S_KEY` is invalid,
        so potential data breach occured on the _**client**_ side or simply
        _**user**_ made a typo in `KEY`. In such scenario next steps
        are impossible, so the procedure has to be aborted,
        _failure counter_ has to be increased and the _**client**_ has
        to be notified. Security precautions can be implemented in this step,
        for example after `3` failed attempts communication with this
        _**client**_ should be suspended for a longer period of time, etc.

    - generate `SKP`:

        ```javascript
        let SKP = StellarSDK.Keypair.fromSecret(S_SECRET)
        ```

    - compute `S_SIGNATURE` by singing `TX_PAYLOAD` with `SKP`:

        ```javascript
        let S_SIGNATURE = txops.signTSB(SKP, TX_PAYLOAD)
        ```

    - [üí•] - destroy `SKP` and `S_SECRET`

    - compute `C_PASSPHRASE`:

        ```javascript
        let C_PASSPHRASE = cryptops.genKey(S_KEY, PEPPER)
        ```

    - send `C_PASSPHRASE` and `S_SIGNATURE` to the _**client**_

    - [üí•] - destroy `S_KEY`, `PEPPER`, `C_PASSPHRASE`


* _**client**_ - [üé≠]:

    - receive `C_PASSPHRASE` and `S_SIGNATURE` from the _**server**_

    - compute `C_KEY`:

        ```javascript
        let C_KEY = cryptops.deriveKey(C_PASSPHRASE, SALT)
        ```

    - extract `C_SECRET` by decrypting `ENC_CKP`:

        ```javascript
        let C_SECRET = cryptops.decrypt(C_KEY, ENC_CKP)
        ```

    - generate `CKP`:

        ```javascript
        let CKP = StellarSDK.Keypair.fromSecret(C_SECRET)
        ```

    - compute `C_SIGNATURE` by singing `TX_PAYLOAD` with `CKP`:

        ```javascript
         let C_SIGNATURE = txops.signTSB(CKP, TX_PAYLOAD)
         ```

    - [üí•] - destroy `CKP`, `C_SECRET`, `C_PASSPHRASE` and `C_KEY`

    - send `S_SIGNATURE` and `C_SIGNATURE` to the _**host application**_


* _**host application**_ - [üíª]:

    - attach received signatured to constructed transaction

    - send the signed transaction to the _[stellar] network_

<br />
<br />
<br />




# Offboarding process _(idea)_

* _**User**_ uses his/her `G_MNEMONIC` with `PASSPHRASE` to generate `GKP`
  and dissociate (with an appropriate _[setOptions]_ operation) `C_PUBLIC`
  and `S_PUBLIC` keys from his/her account.


* _**User**_ demands from _shambhala_ (by calling appropriate API function)
  to delete `ENC_CKP` and `ENC_SKP` structures.


* _Shambhala_ checks `signers` array on a `G_PUBLIC` account and if there are
  no `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC` signers, then `ENC_CKP` and `ENC_SKP` can
  be safely deleted.

<br />
<br />
<br />




# Notes

* There's no way to enforce garbage collect process / shredding of
    memory remains in JavaScript. All places marked with [üí•] are currently
    hard (unknown) to achieve in a JavaScript environment.


* After onboarding it is desirable to turn off the phone / computer
    for at least 30 (??) seconds to wipe out DRAM.


* Steps marked with [‚ùó] in the onboarding process are fragile from
    the security point of view. They are related to very sensitive
    areas - generation of `G_MNEMONIC`, access to and usage of `GKP` and
    `"MASTER" PRIVATE KEY`.


* There is always a tradeoff between security and convenience. Also,
    the more convenient a solution is (in the sense, that an _**user**_ is not
    neccesarily an expert in a given field), the more chance there is
    that some degree of trust to a third party has to be calculated in.


* Safety of a described scheme is build on a following foundations:

    - all communication between _**host application**_ and _**client**_
        is done within browser and using [cross-origin communication] methods
    - all communication betwen _**client**_ and _**server**_ is done
        over [HTTPS]
    - there are two equally important keypairs (`CKP` and `SKP`), both
        stored in an encrypted form (`ENC_CKP` and `ENC_SKP` respectively)
    - _secret keys_ of both `CKP` and `SKP` are never leaving their
        environments (that is [Web Storage] in case of `CKP` and server-side
        database in case of `SKP`)
    - _**user**_ **knows** `PIN` and **has** `SALT`, which are the two
        neccessary ingredients to derive `S_KEY` needed to decrypt `SKP`,
        so in case of server-side database breach `SKP` is safe
    - decryption of `CKP` depends on _**user**_ **knowledge** (`PIN`) and,
        amongs other things, on element stored in **encrypted form** on server
        (`PEPPER`), so in case of client-side storage breach `CKP` is safe
    - if _**user**_ will loose a device with stored `CKP` or forget a `PIN` or
        simply want to cancel using _shambhala transaction-signing scheme_,
        his/her funds on the _[stellar] network_ are safe, because he/she
        **knows** `G_MNEMONIC` with `PASSPHRASE` from which the **master key**
        can be derived
    - the same apply to the situation in which eventual server-side data loss
        occurs - **master key** is in the posession of a _**user**_, so funds
        on the _[stellar] account_ are safe and accessible


* Strong emphasis has to be put on all security considerations related to
    onboarding process in **[Variant A]**.
