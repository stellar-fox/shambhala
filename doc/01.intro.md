# Preface

* Convenient and secure transaction-signing scheme based on:

    - [Multisignature][multisig]
    - [Symmetric encryption][symenc]
    - [Web Storage]
    - In-browser [cross-origin communication]


* _**User**_ is the only owner of the `"MASTER" MNEMONIC` with an optional
    `PASSPHRASE` (see [BIP-39]) and thus effectively he/she is
    **the only owner** of the `"MASTER" PRIVATE KEY` to his/her account,
    rendering him/her **the one and only person "in charge" of that account**.


* Opt-out from shambhala on _**user**_ demand can't be prevented (owner of the
    `"MASTER" PRIVATE KEY` can do with his account whatever he/she desires to).


* [Transaction XDR][transaction] and [signatures][signature] exchange is done
    using in-browser [cross-origin communication] preventing most of
    the threats listed in [Security Best Practices][SEP07sec] chapter
    of [SEP-0007].


* Variants of onboarding / modes of operation:

    - **[Variant A]** - generates `"MASTER" MNEMONIC` for a _**user**_
        and allows him/her to choose a `PASSPHRASE`:

        - for the "first-time"/new users
        - and/or without the prior experience with _[stellar] network_
        - and/or without much knowledge about [crypto][cryptography] in general

    - **[Variant B]** - assumes that _**user**_ already have an account on the
        _[stellar] network_:

        - for users already possesing account on the _[stellar] network_
        - and/or for experienced users with _[stellar] network_ knowledge
        - and/or possesing _[LedgerHQ] device_

<br />

# Basic operations

Current set of basic operations is build on top of:

* [Stanford Javascript Crypto Library][sjcl]
* _node.js_ [crypto][node-crypto] module and [crypto-browserify] implementation
* [Tweet NaCl JavaScript][tweetnacl-js] library
* [scrypt-js] library
* [stellar JavaScript SDK][js-stellar-sdk]
* [redshift] library

For current implementation please refer to [cryptops.js] and [txops.js].

<br />




## Crypto-related operations

* generation of a random value which can be used as a [salt]:

    ```javascript
    // random 256-bit value
    const salt32 = () => { ... }

    // random 512-bit value
    const salt64 = () => { ... }
    ```


* [password-based key-derivation][key-derivation]:

    ```javascript
    // pbkdf2, not too many iterations, 256-bit output
    const genKey = (pass, salt32) => { ... }

    // scrypt, 2^16 iterations, 512-bit output
    const deriveKey = (pass, salt64) => { ... }
    ```


* [symmetric][sym-key] [encryption]:

    ```javascript
    // two round xsalsa20-poly1305/aes encryption,
    // key composed of two 256-bit keys
    const encrypt = (key, secret) => { ... }
    ```


* [symmetric][sym-key] decryption:

    ```javascript
    // two round aes/xsalsa20-poly1305 decryption,
    // key composed of two 256-bit keys
    const decrypt = (key, ciphertext) => { ... }
    ```


* generation of [Universally Unique Identifier]:

    ```javascript
    // monotonic, 128-bit value:
    //     - 48 bits of miliseconds since epoch
    //     - 32 bits of truncated `sha256` sum of userAgent string
    //     - 48 random bits
    const genUUID = () => { ... }
    ```

<br />




## Transaction-related operations

* [transaction] inspection:

    ```javascript
    // decode relevant information from a given
    // `TransactionSignatureBase` XDR
    const inspectTSB = (tsbXDR) => { ... }
    ```


* [transaction] signing:

    ```javascript
    // sign given `TransactionSignatureBase` XDR using provided
    // stellar KeyPair and produce valid signature
    const signTSB = (kp, tsbXDR) => { ... }
    ```

<br />

    - no assumptions


* _**client**_:

    ```javascript
    let clientData = {
        G_PUBLIC: null,
        C_UUID: null,
        C_PUBLIC: null,
        S_PUBLIC: null,

    }
    ```

<br />




## 2. **[Variant A]** - Account creation

_**User**_ doesn't have an account on _[stellar] network_.

* _**client**_:

    - [‚ùó] - generate `G_MNEMONIC` and present it to the _**user**_:

        ```javascript
        let G_MNEMONIC = redshift.genMnemonic()
        ```

    - ask _**user**_ to create `PASSPHRASE` (can be empty)

    - [‚ùó] - create `GKP` (_path 0_):

        ```javascript
        let GKP = func.compose(
            redshift.keypair,
            redshift.hexSeed
        )(G_MNEMONIC)
        ```

    - [üí•] - destroy `G_MNEMONIC`

    - extract `G_PUBLIC`, store it and send it to the _**server**_:

        ```javascript
        let G_PUBLIC = GKP.publicKey()
        ```

    - generate `C_UUID`, store it and send it to the _**server**_:

        ```

    - request funding from the _**server**_


* _**server**_:

    - receive `G_PUBLIC` and `C_UUID` from the _**client**_ and store them

    - ask _[sfox service]_ (_friendbot_ on _[test net]_) to fund `G_PUBLIC`
        with minimal needed amount to perform appropriate _[setOptions]_
        operation assigning two new [ed25519] keys as signers

<br />




## 3. **[Variant B]** - Account association

_**user**_ already has a _[stellar] network_ account with funds.

* _**client**_:

    - ask _**user**_ to provide `G_PUBLIC`

    - validate checksum of the provided `G_PUBLIC`:

        ```javascript
        StellarSDK.Keypair.fromPublicKey(G_PUBLIC)
        ```

    - generate `C_UUID`, store it and send it to the _**server**_:

        ```javascript
        let C_UUID = cryptops.genUUID()
        ```

    - store `G_PUBLIC` and send it to the _**server**_


* _**server**_:

    - receive `G_PUBLIC` and `C_UUID` from the _**client**_ and store them

<br />

        ```javascript
        let SALT_FOR_S = cryptops.salt64()
        ```

    -  ask _**user**_ to provide `PIN` (should be double-checked
        by two independent input fields)

    - compute `S_KEY`:

        ```javascript
        let S_KEY = cryptops.deriveKey(PIN, SALT_FOR_S)
        ```

    - send `S_KEY` to the _**server**_

    - [üí•] - destroy `PIN` and `S_KEY`


* _**server**_:

    - receive `S_KEY` from the _**client**_

    - generate `S_SECRET`:

        ```javascript
        let S_SECRET = StellarSDK.Keypair.random().secret()
        ```

    - extract `S_PUBLIC` from `S_SECRET` and store it:

        ```

    - [üí•] - destroy `C_PASSPHRASE`, `C_KEY`, `C_SECRET`

<br />




## 5. Actual state

* _**user**_:

    - know his/her `G_MNEMONIC` and an optional `PASSPHRASE`
    - know his/her `PIN`
    - know his/her account public address - `G_PUBLIC`
    - is aware that `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC` have been created


* _**client**_:

    ```javascript
    let clientData = {
        G_PUBLIC: "GDVKSJYZ...",
        C_UUID: "01663f03...",
        C_PUBLIC: "GDNQLOS2...",
        S_PUBLIC: "GASVBIEZ...",
        C_SALT: "1f93a39461e87f2320071ad38362685...",
        ENC_CKP: "2rAAAey7/PNEaPpKNG8BtEZZOXFGaXLPDG...",
        SALT_FOR_S: "a65e8ff1b50bfc405828e7..."
    }
    ```


* _**server**_:

    ```javascript
    let serverData = {
        G_PUBLIC: "GDVKSJYZ...",
        C_UUID: "01663f03...",
        S_PUBLIC: "GASVBIEZ...",
        ENC_SKP: "AWY/D5eKB9FxqqS/wt8XDgfDy..."
    }
    ```

<br />




## 6. **[Variant A]** - Keys association

* _**client**_:

    - [‚ùó] - `GKP` is present in memory (_NOT_ in the persistent storage),
        as it was created in step two of **Account creation**.

    - `G_PUBLIC`, `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC` are present in memory

    - construct `StellarSDK.Transaction` with an appropriate
        _[setOptions]_ operation:

        - `G_PUBLIC`, `C_PUBLIC`, `S_PUBLIC` _weights_
        - appropriate tresholds
        - `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC` allowed for [multisig] on `G_PUBLIC`

    - [‚ùó] - sign the transaction with `GKP`

    - send signed transaction to the _[stellar] network_

    - [üí•] - destroy `GKP`


* _**server**_:

    - idle

<br />




## 7. **[Variant B]** - Keys association

* _**client**_:

    - `G_PUBLIC`, `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC` are present in memory

    - construct `StellarSDK.Transaction` with an appropriate
        _[setOptions]_ operation:

        - `G_PUBLIC`, `C_PUBLIC`, `S_PUBLIC` _weights_
        - appropriate tresholds
        - `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC` allowed for [multisig] on `G_PUBLIC`

    - present `TX_PAYLOAD` to the _**user**_

    - if _**user**_ has [LedgerHQ], let him sign the transaction with it
        and send the signed transaction to the _[stellar] network_

    - (alternatively): redirect to appropriate place in [Stellar Laboratory]


* _**user**_:

    - use computed `TX_PAYLOAD`, verify it, sign and send
        to the _[stellar] network_ (with the usage of [LedgerHQ] and/or
        [Stellar Laboratory])

<br />
<br />
<br />




# Transaction signing process _(draft)_

<br />


## 1. Initial state

* _**user**_:

    - know his/her `PIN`
    - has already associated `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC`
        to his/her account during the process of onboarding


* _**client**_:

    ```javascript
    let clientData = {
        G_PUBLIC: "GDVKSJYZ...",
        C_UUID: "01663f03...",
        C_PUBLIC: "GDNQLOS2...",
        S_PUBLIC: "GASVBIEZ...",
        C_SALT: "1f93a39461e87f2320071ad38362685...",
        ENC_CKP: "2rAAAey7/PNEaPpKNG8BtEZZOXFGaXLPDG...",
        SALT_FOR_S: "a65e8ff1b50bfc405828e7..."
    }
    ```


* _**server**_:

    ```javascript
    let serverData = {
        G_PUBLIC: "GDVKSJYZ...",
        C_UUID: "01663f03...",
        S_PUBLIC: "GASVBIEZ...",
        ENC_SKP: "AWY/D5eKB9FxqqS/wt8XDgfDy..."
    }
    ```

<br />




## 2. Transaction verification

* _**client**_:

    - decode `TX_PAYLOAD` and present to the _**user**_:

        ```javascript
        return txops.inspectTSB(TX_PAYLOAD)
        ```

        - source account identifier
        - transaction fee
        - sequence number
        - time bounds
        - memo
        - operations

<br />




## 3. Transaction signing

* _**client**_:

    - receive `TX_PAYLOAD` from the _**host application**_

    - ask _**user**_ to provide `PIN`

    - compute `S_KEY`:

        ```javascript
        let S_KEY = cryptops.deriveKey(PIN, SALT_FOR_S)
        ```

    - send `S_KEY` and `TX_PAYLOAD` to the _**server**_

    - [üí•] - destroy `PIN` and `S_KEY`


* _**server**_:

    - receive `S_KEY` and `TX_PAYLOAD` from the _**client**_

    - extract `S_SECRET` and `SALT_FOR_C` by decrypting `ENC_SKP`:

        ```javascript
        let [SALT_FOR_C, S_SECRET] = cryptops.decrypt(S_KEY, ENC_SKP)
        ```

    - if the extraction has failed it means that received `S_KEY` is invalid,
        so potential data breach occured on the _**client**_ side or simply
        _**user**_ made a typo in `KEY`. In such scenario next steps
        are impossible, so the procedure has to be aborted,
        _failure counter_ has to be increased and the _**client**_ has
        to be notified. Security precautions can be implemented in this step,
        for example after `3` failed attempts communication with this
        _**client**_ should be suspended for a longer period of time, etc.

    - generate `SKP`:

        ```javascript
        let SKP = StellarSDK.Keypair.fromSecret(S_SECRET)
        ```

    - compute `S_SIGNATURE` by singing `TX_PAYLOAD` with `SKP`:

        ```javascript
        let S_SIGNATURE = txops.signTSB(SKP, TX_PAYLOAD)
        ```

    - [üí•] - destroy `SKP` and `S_SECRET`

    - compute `C_PASSPHRASE`:

        ```javascript
        let C_PASSPHRASE = cryptops.genKey(S_KEY, SALT_FOR_C)
        ```

    - send `C_PASSPHRASE` and `S_SIGNATURE` to the _**client**_

    - [üí•] - destroy `S_KEY`, `SALT_FOR_C`, `C_PASSPHRASE`


* _**client**_:

    - receive `C_PASSPHRASE` and `S_SIGNATURE` from the _**server**_

    - compute `C_KEY`:

        ```javascript
        let C_KEY = cryptops.deriveKey(C_PASSPHRASE, C_SALT)
        ```

    - extract `C_SECRET` by decrypting `ENC_CKP`:

        ```javascript
        let C_SECRET = cryptops.decrypt(C_KEY, ENC_CKP)
        ```

    - generate `CKP`:

        ```javascript
        let CKP = StellarSDK.Keypair.fromSecret(C_SECRET)
        ```

    - compute `C_SIGNATURE` by singing `TX_PAYLOAD` with `CKP`:

        ```javascript
         let C_SIGNATURE = txops.signTSB(CKP, TX_PAYLOAD)
         ```

    - [üí•] - destroy `CKP`, `C_SECRET`, `C_PASSPHRASE` and `C_KEY`

    - send `S_SIGNATURE` and `C_SIGNATURE` to the _**host application**_

<br />
<br />
<br />




# Offboarding process _(idea)_

* _**User**_ uses his/her `G_MNEMONIC` with `PASSPHRASE` to generate `GKP`
  and dissociate (with an appropriate _[setOptions]_ operation) `C_PUBLIC`
  and `S_PUBLIC` keys from his account.


* _**User**_ demands from shambhala (by calling appropriate API function)
  to delete `ENC_CKP` and `ENC_SKP` structures.


* Shambhala checks `signers` array on a `G_PUBLIC` account and if there are
  no `C_PUBLIC` and `S_PUBLIC` signers, then `ENC_CKP` and `ENC_SKP` can
  be safely deleted.

<br />
<br />
<br />




# Notes

* There's no way to enforce garbage collect process / shredding of
    memory remains in JavaScript. All places marked with [üí•] are currently
    hard (unknown) to achieve in JavaScript environment.


* After onboarding it is desirable to turn off the phone / computer
    for at least 30 (??) seconds to wipe out DRAM.


* Steps marked with [‚ùó] in the onboarding process are fragile from
    the security point of view. They are related to very sensitive
    areas - generation of `G_MNEMONIC`, access to and usage of `GKP` and
    `"MASTER" PRIVATE KEY`.


* There is always a tradeoff between security and convenience. Also,
    the more convenient a solution is (in the sense, that an _**user**_ is not
    neccesarily an expert in a given field), the more chance there is
    that some degree of trust to a third party has to be calculated in.


* Safety of a described scheme is build on a following foundations:

    - there are two equally important keypairs (`CKP` and `SKP`), both
        stored in an encrypted form
    - _secret keys_ of both `CKP` and `SKP` are never leaving their
        environments (that is [Web Storage] in case of `CKP` and server-side
        database in case of `SKP`)
    - _**user**_ **knows** `PIN` and **has** `SALT_FOR_S`, which are the two
        neccessary ingredients to derive `S_KEY` needed to decrypt `SKP`,
        so in case of server-side database breach `SKP` is safe
    - decryption of `CKP` depends on _**user**_ **knowledge** (`PIN`) and,
        amongs other things, on element stored in **encrypted form** on server
        (`SALT_FOR_C`), so in case of client-side storage breach `CKP` is safe
    - if _**user**_ will loose a device with stored `CKP` or forget a `PIN` or
        simply want to cancel using _shambhala transaction-signing scheme_,
        his/her funds on _[stellar] network_ are safe, because he/she
        **knows** `G_MNEMONIC` with `PASSPHRASE` from which the **master key**
        can be derived
    - the same apply to the situation in which eventual server-side data loss
        occurs - **master key** is in the posession of a _**user**_, so funds
        on the stellar account are safe and accessible
